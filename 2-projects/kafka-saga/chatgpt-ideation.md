Prompts and answers that guided my design to kafka-saga project.

## Brainstorm

`give me use cases of saga pattern with kafka`

1. E-commerce Order Processing:

- Use Case: When a customer places an order, multiple microservices are involved in processing the order, such as inventory management, payment processing, and shipping.
- Implementation: Each step in the order processing workflow is represented as a saga. Kafka topics are used to emit events for each step, such as "OrderCreated," "InventoryReserved," "PaymentProcessed," and "OrderShipped." If any step fails, compensating events can be triggered to rollback the changes made by previous steps.

2. **Travel Booking System**:

- Use Case: When a customer books a travel package, various services are involved, such as flight booking, hotel reservation, and car rental.
- Implementation: Each booking process (flight, hotel, car) is represented as a saga. Kafka topics are used to coordinate the workflow across different services. Events are emitted for each step of the booking process, and compensating events are triggered in case of failures to ensure consistency.

3. Financial Transactions:

- Use Case: When processing financial transactions, such as fund transfers or loan approvals, it's critical to maintain data consistency and ensure that transactions are completed successfully.
- Implementation: Each financial transaction is represented as a saga, with Kafka topics used to publish events for each step of the transaction process. This includes steps like validating the transaction, processing the transaction, and updating account balances. Compensating events are triggered if any step fails to maintain consistency.

4. Ride-Sharing Application:

- Use Case: When a user requests a ride, multiple steps are involved, such as driver assignment, ride acceptance, route calculation, and payment processing.
- Implementation: Each step in the ride-sharing workflow is represented as a saga. Kafka topics are used to emit events for each step of the process. If any step fails, compensating events are triggered to undo the changes made by previous steps and maintain data consistency.

5. Healthcare Appointment Scheduling:

- Use Case: When scheduling healthcare appointments, various steps are involved, such as appointment booking, doctor availability verification, and patient confirmation.
- Implementation: Each step in the appointment scheduling process is represented as a saga. Kafka topics are used to publish events for each step, allowing different services to coordinate the workflow. Compensating events are triggered if any step fails to ensure data consistency.

## Implementation Details

`give me a detailed description to implement the Travel Booking System`

1. Define Services: Identify the services involved in the booking process, such as Flight Booking Service, Hotel Reservation Service, and Car Rental Service. Each service should handle its specific part of the booking process.

2. Event-Driven Architecture: Design the system based on an event-driven architecture. Use Kafka topics to publish events and allow services to subscribe to relevant topics.

3. Define Events: Define the events that represent various stages of the booking process. For example:

- `FlightBooked`: Event emitted when a flight is successfully booked.
- `HotelReserved`: Event emitted when a hotel room is successfully reserved.
- `CarRented`: Event emitted when a car is successfully rented.
- `BookingFailed`: Event emitted when any part of the booking process fails.

4. Saga Pattern: Implement the Saga Pattern to coordinate the distributed transactions across services. Each booking process (flight, hotel, car) is represented as a saga, which consists of a series of steps that must be completed atomically.

5. Transaction Coordinator: Implement a Transaction Coordinator component responsible for orchestrating the saga. It listens for booking requests and initiates the corresponding saga.

6. Saga Steps: Define individual steps within each saga to perform specific actions and emit events. For example:

- Flight Booking Saga: Reserve seat on the flight; Emit `FlightBooked` event if successful.
- Hotel Reservation Saga: Reserve room in the hotel; Emit `HotelReserved` event if successful.
- Car Rental Saga: Rent a car; Emit `CarRented` event if successful.

7. Compensation Steps: Implement compensation steps for each saga to handle failures and ensure consistency. If any step in the saga fails, compensating events are triggered to undo the changes made by previous steps.

- For example, if the flight booking fails, trigger a `CancelFlightBooking ` event to release the reserved seat.

8. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle failures gracefully. If a saga fails at any step, initiate compensation steps to rollback the changes and maintain system consistency.

9. Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the progress of sagas and diagnose issues. Use Kafka topic partitions to track the state of each saga instance.

10. Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of each saga and ensure that compensating events are triggered correctly in case of failures.

## Saga Use Cases Deep Dive

`describe in details how the saga steps will work, cover edge cases and define the events for each step of the travel booking process and how they will be structured and handled by kafka`

1. Booking Initiation:

- When a customer initiates a travel booking, a saga is started to coordinate the booking process.
- This step involves collecting all necessary information from the customer, such as destination, travel dates, preferences, etc.
- Edge Case: Handle scenarios where the customer provides incomplete or invalid information. The saga should gracefully handle such cases and inform the customer accordingly.
- Event Name: `BookingInitiated`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "customer_id": "<customer_id>", "destination": "<destination>", "travel_dates": "<travel_dates>", ... }`
- Kafka Topic: `booking_initiated`

2. Flight Booking:

- The first step in the saga is to book the flight for the customer.
- A message is sent to a Kafka topic indicating the flight booking request.
- A flight booking service listens to this topic, processes the request, and emits events indicating the status of the booking.
- Edge Case: If the flight booking fails (e.g., no available seats, technical issues), a compensating event is triggered to undo any partial bookings and inform the customer.
- Event Name: `FlightBookingRequest`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "customer_id": "<customer_id>", "flight_details": { "flight_number": "<flight_number>", "departure_date": "<departure_date>", ... } }`
- Kafka Topic: `flight_booking_requests`

3. Hotel Reservation:

- After the flight booking is successful, the next step is to reserve a hotel room.
- Similar to the flight booking step, a message is sent to another Kafka topic for hotel reservation.
- A hotel reservation service processes the request and emits events for success or failure.
- Edge Case: Handle scenarios where the desired hotel is fully booked or unavailable for the specified dates. Trigger compensating events if necessary.
- Event Name: `HotelReservationRequest`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "customer_id": "<customer_id>", "hotel_details": { "hotel_name": "<hotel_name>", "checkin_date": "<checkin_date>", ... } }`
- Kafka Topic: `hotel_reservation_requests`

4. Car Rental:

- Once the flight and hotel are booked, the final step is to arrange for a rental car.
- Again, a message is sent to a Kafka topic for car rental.
- A car rental service processes the request and emits events accordingly.
- Edge Case: If car rental fails (e.g., no available cars, rental service outage), trigger compensating events and inform the customer.
- Event Name: `CarRentalRequest`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "customer_id": "<customer_id>", "car_details": { "car_type": "<car_type>", "pickup_date": "<pickup_date>", ... } }`
- Kafka Topic: `car_rental_requests`

5. Booking Completion:

- After all steps are completed successfully, the saga concludes, and the customer is notified of their confirmed travel arrangements.
- If any step fails, the saga triggers compensating events to undo any partial bookings and informs the customer about the failure.
- Event Name: `BookingCompleted`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "customer_id": "<customer_id>", "confirmation_details": { "flight_booking_id": "<flight_booking_id>", "hotel_reservation_id": "<hotel_reservation_id>", "car_rental_id": "<car_rental_id>", ... } }`
- Kafka Topic: `booking_completed`

#### Compensating Events (for Failure Cases)

1. Notify Booking Failed:

- Event Name: `BookingFailed`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "customer_id": "<customer_id>", "failure_reason": "<reason>", ... }`
- Kafka Topic: `booking_failed`

2. Compensate Flight Booking:

- Event Name: `UndoFlightBooking`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "flight_booking_id": "<flight_booking_id>", ... }`
- Kafka Topic: `undo_flight_booking`

3. Compensate Hotel Reservation:

- Event Name: `UndoHotelReservation`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "hotel_reservation_id": "<hotel_reservation_id>", ... }`
- Kafka Topic: `undo_hotel_reservation`

4. Compensate Car Rental:

- Event Name: `UndoCarRental`
- Structure: `{ "booking_id": "<booking_id>", "car_rental_id": "<car_rental_id>", ... }`
- Kafka Topic: `undo_car_rental`
